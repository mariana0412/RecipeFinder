(she says she cooks it to approx. 248 degrees f). so, instead of going through the trouble of trial and error, i have always used the drop test method, and it has worked for me every time. i will explain this method for those who don't know it in the directions.",

    "description": "my colleague grace made up these these wonderful gift boxes of goodies including this recipe. these are so good and when i found out how easy they are to make, i was sold! personally i like to  use semi sweet chocolate chips, but that is personal preference. split you wafers before  placing in the pan but fit them tightly together--the grahams that split to approx 1x2 inches are ideal, but cut them to the size you like.  after you have made the almond roca and cooled the tray, put it in the freezer for only 10 minutes to really solidify the chocolate.  then remove from freezer and flip the whole tray so you can see where the graham wafer splits are. it is then very easy to just slice gently with a knife and you get perfect cut pieces. i store mine in a tin box in the fridge, but if you have chocoholics they won't last so just put them out on a plate!",
