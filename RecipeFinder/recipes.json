In fact, it is so sinful it could have only been created in new orleans, and in fact it was, at elizabeth\u2019s restaurant in 1998. The flavor marriage of pralines and good smoky bacon is so wrong that it just has to be right.

I wasn't going to have a chance to stir the chicken so i wanted to make sure that it covered all of the chicken. I served this over brown basmati rice. The marinating time is not included. ****note: i do not recommend marinating this for more than 2 hours. I find it gets a grainy texture if marinated too long. Enjoy!",

We like to add 1 or 2 of the variations, there's always something left over in the fridge to be used up, use your imagination. (the oil can be replaced with veggie cooking spray, it works just as well) our standard is deli chicken slices, a mix of cheddar and parmesan, green pepper sticks, and chopped green onions and fresh cilantro, served with hot salsa. Yummy!!!",

We will never buy granola from the store again! This is so easy and delicious; everyone should try it! Some of my family members mix in raisins or almonds just before eating (no need to bake them.)  but remember you must stir the granola after it bakes for 10 minutes. I didn't read the recipe carefully and burnt my first batch. Enjoy.;)",

        "description": "My mom adapted this from several recipes she found, in an attempt to copy the arroz con leche that we had while i was studying in merida, in mexico's yucatan peninsula. The bakery sold it in little plastic cups, at room temperature. This isn't a true 'pudding' since it doesn't have any eggs--but it sure is good! I haven't actually made this myself yet--just enjoyed it at mom's house! Warming the milk before adding to the rice helps to avoid longer cooking times. Simply warm the milk in the microwave or in another pan shortly before adding it to the rice. This dish can easily be halved if you don't need such a large amount (or doubled if you need more). This is a nice recipe to pour into individual serving dishes (custard cups or ramekins work well) while still warm. Sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon to garnish, cool, and eat cold or at room temperature.",

        "description": "The aromatic scent of holidays and mum's home baking, mixed spice is an essential jar on the spice rack. Mixed spice is a blend of sweet spices traditionally used in english cooking to provide a warming backnote. This typically english spice mixture can be purchased ready-mixed, but i prefer to make my own, as i find it difficult to find in france and i have my own special blend. It is essential for fruit cakes, christmas plum pudding, mincemeat and hot cross buns; mixed spice is also a great addition to other fruity desserts such as apple & fruit pies, crumbles and compotes. Try it in cream cheese desserts, pickles, chutneys and mulled wine too. Make it up and buy the spices needed in small quantities, as the mixture soon loses its full rich flavour. Allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger are the usual blend of spices, but i sometimes like to add a few ground cardamom seeds as well as some ground coriander seeds. This spice mixture makes an unusual and attractive gift - tie a ribbon around the neck of the jar, with pretty paper and then add a seasonal recipe tag.",

I adapted it just a bit using regular mustard and honey instead of dijon mustard. It turned out great and my husband says he prefered it cooked this way over the honey baked ham! It wasn't near as salty and had a wonderful flavor! Plus, the cost of preparing this ham was about 1/3 of the cost of a honey baked ham!",

My parents say this recipe tastes better than the ones they've had in canadian chinese restaurants. Once you get the hang of making it, you'll want to make it often. If you don't want to spend the time making pancakes, you can use soft tortillas to replace. The homemade pancakes are much better though.

In scandinavia, the summer solstice is a magical time. The lavender twilight lasts until 11 p.m. And the day breaks again at about 2 a.m.; above  the arctic circle, the sun doesn't sink below the horizon for weeks. This year, 2007, midsummer eve, the beginning of the three day official holiday,  falls on june 25. Throughout scandinavia, families and friends gather  to decorate the maypole with birch leaves and wildflowers, make flower crowns for women and girls, dance around the maypole, sing summer songs and feast on  pickled herring, new potatoes, and aquavit. In addition, many families have their own special foods that they traditionally serve as the midsummer meal. These are usually dishes that can be prepared ahead of time and easily served outdoors.",

The salad is at its height only very briefly, and after the moment has passed, it\u2019s passed and nothing in the world can bring it back\u2026. Everyone should be sitting down and ready to eat before you start tossing the salad. And get the salad plates out of the freezer only as the salad is completed.

        "description": "I first had one of these wonderful sandwiches just after i had moved to cyprus; i remember sitting in an old, rundown taverna with a chilled keo beer, whilst gazing out towards the deep blue mediterranean sea! Bliss! They are usually made in long, fat finger rolls, similar to hoagies or sub rolls, but you can also make them with pitta bread or other shapes of bread rolls. Halloumi is a traditional cypriot cheese, which is still made locally by lots of cypriot ladies - you often see the cheeses \"hanging out to dry\" in old, but hopefully clean (?) tights or stockings! Halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. You can buy packs of good quality cypriot halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. It can last for up to one year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack! Halloumi is the greek cypriot name for this cheese, the turkish cypriots call it hellim - it is the same cheese however, and the best cheese is made with 100% sheep\u2019s milk. You will find these sandwiches all over cyprus in different guises, this is my favourite combination.",

        "description": "A fabulous recipe for a soft set strawberry jam, or rather a strawberry conserve, where most of the fruit remains whole and is suspended in a delicious strawberry flavoured jammy syrup! This conserve reminds me of the traditional cream teas you get in the west country of england - especially devon and cornwall; a pot of tea served with fluffy fresh scones, butter, thick cream and this strawberry conserve. (preparation time includes the 2 days allowed for the fruit to stand in the sugar.) this type of jam recipe  is also very french, they tend to have a softer set jam here in france - it is lovely to see whole pieces of fruit on your toast or scones! I also use this for steamed puddings - absolutely divine!",

        "description": "My aunt cathy has been making caramel candies for us for christmas for 25 years. I have never tasted caramels as good as hers. They are always soft and creamy with a wonderful flavor. With this recipe you can make your caramel as soft or as hard as you want to. Because confection recipes are always easily affected by altitude, my aunt, who lives at a much lower elevation than me, suggested i use the drop test method instead of a candy thermometer for figuring out how hard or soft my caramel is going to turn out. I went along with her suggestion because, for one i didn't want to spring for a candy thermometer, and also because the temperature i would need to cook it to would differ for me from what she would cook it to and so she couldn't tell me what that temperature would be. (she says she cooks it to approx. 248 degrees f). So, instead of going through the trouble of trial and error, i have always used the drop test method, and it has worked for me every time. I will explain this method for those who don't know it in the directions.",

If you want burnt ends, you can certainly make them, but it's doubtful that you will want to. You will need a hot charcoal fire, extra long handled tongs, a smoker large enough to accomodate the meat, a large h.d.

Any bread should work with this recipe, but the recipe specified baguette. Instructions for using toasted bread instead of dried are my own. Toasting instructions should be reduced for thinner sliced bread (less than 3/4-1 inch). I tried this recipe using toasted sourdough bread and my only recommendation is that you process in batches.

They are so pretty for the holidays - you can decorate these with any color sprinkles, candy m&m's, i've even used hershey's hugs mini-morsels.. The possibilites are endless, just make to suit your occasion... Great with bright sprinkles for birthdays, or pastel m&m's for easter, etc. - have fun!

I noticed pudding is less popular than cake, and of course, cake is more suited for parties, especially those with kids. You can use your choice of cake flavor, but pay attention to the cookie crumbs you use in that case so they are compatible flavors. You also probably wouldn't want to use chocolate icing with a pumpkin cake, but if you wanted a pumpkin frosting, that would be good, or else use vanilla.you can use whipped cream to make the ghosties, but be aware that if you do this, the cake needs to remain chilled, and the whipped cream does try to sag and run after awhile (so don't do that too far in advance). The marshmallow ghosties are more durable at room temp. Those are often sold near displays of halloween candy, not necessarily by the bags of marshmallows.",

        "description": "This recipe hails from one of my favourite restaurants, \"the witchery - by the castle\" in edinburgh, scotland, which is towards the top up the hill near the gates of edinburgh castle. The restaurant is located in a very old and atmospheric building where the \"old hell fire club\" used to hold their meetings. The witchery serves this delicious steak there, called steak balmoral, which has the most divine whisky sauce i have ever tasted! Serve this steak with chips (french fries), boiled, jacket or steamed new potatoes and seasonal greens or a tossed salad. The sauce is uniquely famous for its stunning simplicity - no need for onions or garlic, the cream, mustard, mushrooms and whisky tick all the taste boxes! More information from the restaurant's web-site: located in an historic sixteenth-century building at the gates of edinburgh castle, james thomson's witchery is the most atmospheric and spectacular dining destination in the city. A unique location,stunning interiors and superlative food, wine and service create memorable and magical dining experiences for locals, visitors and celebrities alike. Ewan macgregor, michael douglas, catherine zeta jones, jack nicholson and clarissa dickson wright have all succumbed to its charms, with andrew lloyd webber calling it the prettiest restaurant ever! Originally built for an edinburgh merchant in 1595, this historic building on the royal mile now includes the jewel-like witchery diningroom, the spectacular secret garden and a collection of totally indulgent and opulent suites on the floors above and in an adjacent historic building. (this recipe is the authentic recipe from the restaurant's web-site.)",

You can double or triple the spices to your taste, as suggested by other people who rated this recipe at epicurious.com. I doubled this recipe to use a whole 29-oz. Can of pumpkin, which made 2 pies. I didn't have molasses so i used good pancake syrup in place of it, and it turned out really well. I used the recipe for flaky pie crust for the crust, but you can also use frozen pie crust. Adjust the baking time to your oven, the recipe calls for 50 minutes, but my oven took 55 minutes. Bon appetit, november 1998, mary dillman burke, aiken sc, the cook's exchange.",

The recipe can be made using half ground beef and ground pork if desired yield is only estimated depending on the amount of filling used in the burrito, all amounts may be adjusted to suit taste.",

        "description": "There are similar versions to this cookie, but i truly think that if you make mine like directed, you will find that these are the best. They will melt in your mouth. This has been a recipe used in my family since i was a little girl. We always made them for christmas and weddings, but they are good anytime. The key is to use butter and make sure you grind the nuts very fine. I use my kitchen aid grinder attachment, but you can also use a food processor. Other versions use just chopped nuts, but i think when they are finely ground that makes the difference. Another important step is to bake them at 250 degrees for 45 minutes. Again, the other versions don't do this, but i stick with my recipe and am never disappointed. The extra time is worth it! This recipe will probably make 100 balls, depending on how large you make the cookies. The baking time listed is just an estimate. It will vary depending on how many cookies you make and how many you put on a cookie sheet. You can fit quite a bit on a cookie sheet because they really don't spread much.",

        "description": "This recipe comes from \"baking\" by dorie greenspan, a fabulous book. I have been doing a lot of research on flour and for biscuits the consensus is use white lily flour. Unfortunately, it's not easy to find in the pnw, so here is a great compromise, cake and unbleached flour. Dorie also suggests using you hands to quickly incorporate the butter into the flour, the butter should end up coated and not uniform in size. The dough can be made, wrapped air-tight and frozen for up to 2 months. If you like a crisper edge, do not let the baking biscuits touch. If you like a softer edge on the biscuit, place the biscuits on the baking tray touching each other.",

And all of them are divine! You can fix a different crab dish or appetizer every night of the week for a full year. Crabs are not grown on the farm. But we do have a special supplier to us called, \"gibby's seafood market\" that sell their steamed crabs from the night before at a reduced rate. Now you have to get there soon in the morning right after they open but those crabs are seasoned with \"old bay seasoning\" (a staple of maryland, made in maryland) and oh so good. Anyway, whenever there is a get together be it winter, spring, summer, fall there is always a crab dish. This ia a good appetizer to serve, people just grab with their hands and devour, making sure they have licked the last bit off their hands or even plates. Go ahead, try it, i promise there won't be much left for you. Have fun add or subtract whatever you see fit.",

        "description": "My colleague grace made up these these wonderful gift boxes of goodies including this recipe. These are so good and when i found out how easy they are to make, i was sold! Personally i like to  use semi sweet chocolate chips, but that is personal preference. Split you wafers before  placing in the pan but fit them tightly together--the grahams that split to approx 1x2 inches are ideal, but cut them to the size you like. After you have made the almond roca and cooled the tray, put it in the freezer for only 10 minutes to really solidify the chocolate. Then remove from freezer and flip the whole tray so you can see where the graham wafer splits are. It is then very easy to just slice gently with a knife and you get perfect cut pieces. I store mine in a tin box in the fridge, but if you have chocoholics they won't last so just put them out on a plate!",

However, it seems i have limited it's possibilities by implying that it should be reserved for apples solely from the recipe's title. That is not the case!! Why should you try this dip? Well the marshmallow and cream cheese dip is great, but i believe it's the cinnamon that really sets it apart!! I think you could put the ingredients on a long list of things, but i'll let you use your own creativity for that. I prefer it with very tart apples, such as northern spy or granny smith, but have used it with all sorts since dh likes sweet and softer apples. It is very good and very easy and can be prepared in advance, such as for parties.",

        "description": "I recently tried a russian honey cake, which was one of the yummiest cakes i have ever tasted. It was so nice i decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. It took me about 6 months searching the net (on websites mostly in russian, which i definitely don't read or speak) translating from russian using an online translator, and trying different recipes before i found this recipe, which has produced a result at least as nice as the one i tried. I baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. Each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done. The cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. The sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. The original recipe said to add sugar \"by intuition\"; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet! I have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). This was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. A slightly different taste, but a very nice variation. I personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.",

        "description": "My take on cape malay curry powder; i devised this when i finally finished my precious box of this type of curry powder, that had been sent to me in a herbs and spices swap by zurie! I checked the ingredients list and finally after a little trial and error, i came up with this, and it is a pretty close match! Influenced by malay cuisine, cape/malay curry powder/masala is a blend of sweet and pungent spices to include cloves, cardamon, fennel, mustard, coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, a little chilli and black pepper. A curry powder/masala of a mild heat yet full of the flavours you expect in indian curry. This curry spice mix is wonderful in all types of curries, but especially authentic cape malay style cuisine, and of course curries.",

        "description": "Africa has a long history of banana cultivation. Phytolith discoveries in cameroon dating to the first millennium bce triggered an as yet unresolved debate about the date of first cultivation in africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in madagascar around that time. The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than late 6th century ad. It is likely, however, that bananas were brought at least to madagascar if not to the east african coast during the phase of malagasy colonization of the island from south east asia c400ce. Here we have a simple, healthy drink made with just 1 banana. Idea from the 80/10/10 diet by dr. Douglas n. Graham, a cool raw food book.",

        "description": "I'm a cranberry nut. I just can't get enough of these berries. Here are some fun facts i found on the web. Cranberries are one of the only three native north american fruits (concord grapes, and blueberries being the others). To the eastern indians, cranberries were known as sassamanesh. The cape cod pequots and the south jersey leni- lenape tribes called the little red berry ibimi or bitter berry. But it was the pilgrims who gave the cranberry its modern name. To them, the pink cranberry blossoms resembled the heads of cranes; therefore the word crane berry later contracted to cranberry. Early american sailors carried barrels of cranberries while at sea as a source of vitamin c, much like the british limeys carried limes aboard ships.",

        "description": "This recipe was featured on the rhodes around china tv series on the hong kong leg of the journey. Gary was taught to make these by a couple of local executive chefs. They are incredibly easy to put together, and very flavourful. I sometimes add bean sprouts and peas and corn and leave the meat out to make them vegetarian. Great as a snack, light meal or as part of a buffet. My family, especially the children, love them.",

As i don't like hot and spicy flavours, i made these with a mild paprika. Those who do like foods hot and spicy might want to add cayenne pepper. Please, do adjust the spices to meet your taste preferences. As almonds boost energy levels particularly at those times such as early afternoon when - given the choice - many of us may choose to have a siesta, i intend to have these on hand in a container at all times at work as a quick energy-boosting snack. I've found that even half a dozen almonds can provide the boost needed at such times, and these will offer a more flavoursome alternative to plain almonds.",

        "description": "In south africa \"fruit salad\" means something a little different from most american recipes. A definitive recipe does not exist: you use what fruits you have, and in summer and fall the choice is enormous. This is a healthy, simple way to end any meal, whether humble or grand. Serve with ice cream, sweet whipped cream or custard, or plain, as it comes. Please read extra notes in directions. Prep time and servings are a wild guess, as it will depend entirely on the fruits you choose and how much salad it will actually be: weights cannot be specified for papayas and melons (cantaloupes)!",

        "description": "My aunt received this recipe when she was living in germany years ago. It is awesome! Hard to mess up, easy to change the flavor. I can't eat store bought cheesecake anymore, because this recipe has me spoiled. It is very important that the cream cheese be allowed to soften to room temperature so that the cheesecake will be creamy. The recipe listed is for a plain cheesecake, you can make any flavor though, by using different extracts, or adding berries, chips, etc, or by topping with pie filling, etc. I usually have a little bit of the crust left over. I have found that the top doesn't crack in a 13x9 glass baking dish, but it does crack when baked in a springform pan. If you aren't going to be topping it with something, you could throw a dish of water in the oven while the cheesecake is baking to help prevent the cracking. I never do.",

        "description": "Adapted from a recipe in 'the australian women's weekly's tapas antipasto mezze'. Chorizo sausage - surprisingly not in the zaar kitchen dictionary - is a sausage of spanish origin made from ground pork, garlic and chillies, so if you cannot get chorizo sausages that gives you the general idea: just substitute with a sausage you really like. The appeal of the dish is certainly going to be largely determined by your choice of sausage; and if you like a bit of heat in your food, either choose a spicy sausage or add something like red pepper flakes in step three. 680g? Well, 500g = 1lb; 750g = 11/2lb, and exact quantities are obviously not crucial here. 5mm? 3mm =1/8 inch and 6mm = 1/4 inch. Again, the exact size of the slices is not crucial, but be ready to decrease or increase your cooking time according to the thickness of your sausage slices. You can prepare this recipe to the end of step two earlier in the day (and have the additional ingredients ready) and complete step three just prior to serving.",
